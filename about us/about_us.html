    <h1>Get familiar with our program</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      “2nd Chance” program is looking to help people who have the talent/ability
      and the fortitude to become engineers, but never had the opportunity to do
      so. We start with minimal support. As you prove to be dedicated and
      capable, we will increase the amount of support. Support includes
      financing the course you will take, providing equipment, and for the
      senior candidates even paying living expenses so that you can focus on
      studies full time. Most importantly, support includes time with a mentor,
      who is on the same track, but ahead of you by at least 2 years. To be
      clear, we don&apos;t magically do this instead of you. You put in the work
      and you earn the opportunity to be an engineer. We are just here to make
      the transition easier and faster.
    </p>
    <h2>What we look for in a candidate</h2>

    <p>
      We estimate that the total process will take 6-24 months. The more the
      candidate proves his/her dedication, the more resources and support we
      will provide. If at any point, the mentor finds out the candidate is off
      the track and/or is not dedicated enough, the program stops after 1 failed
      warning.
    </p>
    <h2>Known obstacles</h2>
    <p>
      Failed candidates either give up half way through or do it half-heartedly
      and drag it on for years without becoming really good. Before you commit,
      here are some known obstacles to making this career transition. As you
      will notice, most of these have to do with personality and mindset, not
      technical things like money or equipment. Technical obstacles are easy to
      overcome. Personality is harder.
